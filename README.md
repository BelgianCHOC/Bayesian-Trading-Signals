# Bayesian Inference for Trading Signals

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the use of **Bayesian Inference** to analyze and predict stock price movements. Unlike traditional technical indicators (e.g., moving averages), Bayesian methods provide a **probabilistic framework** that quantifies uncertainty in market trends. The model is backtested and compared against classical approaches to assess its predictive power.

## 🚀 Features
- **Bayesian Regression Model**: Predicts price movements with probabilistic confidence intervals.
- **Comparison with Classical Models**: Includes moving averages and linear regression for benchmarking.
- **Backtesting Framework**: Tests trading strategies using real stock data.
- **Visualization Tools**: Plots market trends, predictions, and confidence intervals.

## ⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bayesian-Trading-Signals.git
cd Bayesian-Trading-Signals
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Data Collection
We use **Yahoo Finance API** to fetch historical stock price data.
```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def fetch_data(ticker, start_date, end_date):
    stock = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)
    return stock[['Close']]

# Example: Fetch Apple stock data from 2020 to 2023
data = fetch_data('AAPL', '2020-01-01', '2023-12-31')
print(data.head())
```

## 🔢 Bayesian Model Implementation
Using **PyMC3**, we fit a Bayesian regression model to forecast stock prices:
```python
import pymc3 as pm
import numpy as np

with pm.Model() as bayesian_model:
    alpha = pm.Normal('alpha', mu=0, sigma=10)
    beta = pm.Normal('beta', mu=0, sigma=10)
    sigma = pm.HalfNormal('sigma', sigma=1)
    
    x = np.arange(len(data))
    y_obs = data['Close'].values
    y_est = alpha + beta * x
    likelihood = pm.Normal('y', mu=y_est, sigma=sigma, observed=y_obs)
    
    trace = pm.sample(1000, return_inferencedata=True)
```

## 📈 Results & Backtesting
- **Performance Metrics:** Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown
- **Trading Strategy:** Buy when Bayesian confidence interval indicates an upward trend, sell otherwise.
- **Visualization:** Plots actual vs. predicted prices with uncertainty bands.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Explore **Hierarchical Bayesian Models** for multi-asset prediction.
- Incorporate **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) optimizations**.
- Implement **Reinforcement Learning for trading strategies**.
